        <h3>Education</h3>

            alt="Educational id a powerful" width="250px"> <br> <br>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; <span
            style="font-size: 30px;">Education</span> is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and
          manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as
          public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs
          outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily
          experiences.<span style="background-color: aqua;">Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels,
            including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.</span>
          Other classifications focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and student-centered education, and
          on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical education. Additionally, the term
          "education" can denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals and the academic field studying
          educational phenomena.

          The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements about the aims of education and
          the extent to which education differs from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements
          impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various forms of education. <u><b>Essentially,</b></u> education
          socializes children into society by instilling cultural values and norms, equipping them with the skills
          necessary to become productive members of society. In doing so, it stimulates economic growth and raises
          awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions play a significant role in education. For
          instance, governments establish education policies to determine the timing of school classes, the curriculum,
          and attendance requirements. International organizations, such as <u><b>UNESCO,</b></u> have been influential
          in promoting primary education for all children.</p>

            alt="friends & friends" width="250px">&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; <span
            style="font-size: 30px;">Friends</span> is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta
          Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons.[1] With an ensemble
          cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer,
          the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and early 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. The
          original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane.

          Kauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the working title Insomnia Cafe between November and
          December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show
          to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes to Six of One[2] and Friends Like
          Us, the series was finally named Friends.[3] Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank,
          California. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions and Warner Bros. Television.</p>

        <h3>The Purpose Driven Life

            alt="The Defining Nature of Purpose - The Congruence Framework" width="250px">&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;
          <span style="font-size: 30px;">Purpose</span>The Purpose Driven Life is a bible study book written by
          Christian pastor Rick Warren and published by Zondervan in 2002. The book offers readers a 40-day personal
          spiritual journey and presents what Warren says are God's five purposes for human life on Earth.
        <h5>Background</h5>
        Warren was encouraged by Billy Graham in his 20s after he wrote his first book: Rick Warren’s Bible Study
        Methods. This greatly inspired Warren when he had "little confidence" in his writing ability:

        The Purpose Driven Life might have never been written if Billy Graham had not believed in me.[1][2]

        The 2002 book Purpose Driven Life is a sequel to his 1995 book The Purpose Driven Church.
        <h5>Summary</h5>
        The book is intended to be read as a daily inspiration, with each of the 40 short chapters read on consecutive
        days.[3][4] Each chapter contains a personal application section at the end with a "point to ponder," a verse to
        remember, and a question to consider over the course of that day. Rick Warren described his book as an
        "anti-self-help book." The first sentence of the book reads, "It's not about you,"[5] and the remainder of the
        chapter goes on to explain how the quest for personal fulfillment, satisfaction, and meaning can only be found
        in understanding and doing what God placed you on Earth to do.[6] The book's 40 chapters are divided into six
        major sections, with the following titles:[7]
        <ol>
          <li>What on Earth Am I Here For?
            Purpose #1: You Were Planned for God's Pleasure (Christian Worship)</li>
          <li>Purpose #2: You Were Formed for God's Family (Christian Fellowship) </li>
          <li>Purpose #3: You Were Created to Become Like Christ (Discipleship)</li>
          <li>Purpose #4: You Were Shaped for Serving God (Christian Ministry) </li>
          <li>Purpose #5: You Were Made for a Mission (Christian Mission)</li>
        </ol>
